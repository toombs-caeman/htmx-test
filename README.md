This is an experiment to learn about htmx and flask.

The idea is to just spend a handful of hours on it and see how far I can get.

# concept
Using the sqlite "Chinook" sample database, create a nice search interface for that data from scratch.

# features
* display track details
    * goto album view
* search for tracks by name
    * paginate/infinite scroll results
* filter by 

# ref
[flask]
